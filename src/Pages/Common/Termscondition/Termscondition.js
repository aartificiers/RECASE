                                    <p>If there is a dispute between us, we agree to resolve it through binding arbitration. This means that we will not go to court, but instead we will ask an independent arbitrator to decide the dispute for us. The arbitration will be conducted under the rules of the International Commercial Arbitration Court (ICAC) in Belgium. The number of arbitrators will be [number], the seat of arbitration will be [location], the language of the proceedings will be [language], and the governing law of the contract will be [law].</p>
                                    <span>Restrictions</span>
                                    <p>The arbitration will be limited to the dispute between us individually. We cannot join any other parties to the arbitration, and we cannot arbitrate the dispute on a class-action basis. We also cannot bring the dispute in a representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>

                                    <p>The following disputes are not subject to binding arbitration:</p>

                                    <p>If any part of this arbitration provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither party will elect to arbitrate any dispute falling within that portion of the provision found to be illegal or unenforceable.
